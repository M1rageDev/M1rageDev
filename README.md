## Hi there 👋

Hey! I'm Mirage, a tinkerer and programming enthusiast based in Poland. I mostly work in computer vision stuff and electronics but I also sometimes make games in the Unity engine, graphics projects with OpenGL, and KSP mods. Currently working on Firefly - a KSP atmospheric effect overhaul mod. Thanks for stopping by!
